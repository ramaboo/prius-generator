# Prius Generator

I turned my 2012 Prius C into a 900W 120V AC generator in a weekend for less than $300! This open source guide will show you how you can do it as well!





# Why?

- Quieter than a conventional generator!
- Uses substantially less gas.
- No storage or transperation of gas and oil.
- No smell.
- Cheaper!
